# EatClub

### Overview

- 100% compose and kotlin app, following a single activity pattern
- Currently using my stripped down version of MAD architecture.
- Does everything as described in the doc except for location.
- Tried to be as close to design without a Figma file.
- Added some screenshot tests and Unit tests just to showcase proficiency in the same.
- Would have done a few things differently had this been a real project, lets talk about it when we
  meet.
- Using koin for DI - as i was told you guys might use kotlin multiplatform.
- Haven't put lint or arch specific libraries like leak canary, detect (although have its plugin
  enabled for this project), Konsist at this stage

## Installation
